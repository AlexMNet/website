CTO Mike Koss interviewed Jeremiah about his journey to becoming a software engineer and asked his advice for people just getting started.\n\n“I started my YouTube channel because representation definitely matters,” he said. “I didn’t know that you could be a software developer without going to college.” Peoples added that he thought the same thing about being a Black man in tech. “A lot of people out there didn’t know that Black men could get into tech just by learning the skills, so I hope to be that point of representation for people.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/JeremiahPeoples/featured",

In this demo, I show what those three languages do, and how you can use them to create a simple application in a web page.\n\nYou can see the original Pen here: https://codepen.io/mckoss/pen/mdOgEBW\n\nThere is a typo in closing the body tag.  I should have written /body to close it (I left out the slash).  Note that most browsers are lenient with dealing with bugs like this. They try their best to figure out what you meant if you have an error.  Thanks, Jim, for pointing this out.",

        "description": "On Monday, March 22nd, we launched the first week of learning for our software development training program: participants made a decision about which track they would select, and began their journey installing their development environment and completing their first assignments. Our third Town Hall featured the organization Covid Act Now, a group of developers who came together in the beginning of the pandemic to provide timely and accurate data about Covid in every state across the country. CTO Mike Koss interviewed CTO Michael Lehenbauer and software engineer Chelsi Asulin about working in tech and how their simple site – which includes extensive data and easy-to-read visualizations – is helping encourage responsible public health measures across the country. “It’s been a whirlwind,” said Lehenbauer. He said that one of the aspects he likes most about working in tech is that you get to work with amazing people and build really cool things.",

        "title": "Reskill Americans Hosts Nick Curry from AWS for 5th Town Hall, Monday, April 5th",
        "description": "On Monday, April 5th, we hosted our fifth Town Hall which featured our guest speaker, Nick Curry, Head of Military Initiatives, Technical Apprenticeships, and Diversity Internships at Amazon Web Services (AWS).  \n\nNick provided an overview of Amazon’s diversity programs and internship opportunities, including the structure of the program, the qualifications required, and the types of positions (functional area and skillset) that are available.  He spoke about the interview process and Amazon’s focus on 14 leadership principles.  \n\n“We want people who have an insatiable appetite to learn and to develop themselves,” he said. “In an interview, a simple question could be: tell me the last time you learned something. It helps us understand what motivates you and how we can see those skills translating into an Amazon role.” \n\nNick said that one of the benefits of working at Amazon is that you can work anywhere within the organization and get exposed to a wide range of projects. Amazon interns and apprentices support core functions in consumer devices, operations, or in AWS, but they also can work at an Amazon subsidiary or sister company, like IMDB, Audible, Amazon Pharmacy, or Whole Foods. \n\nWhat does Nick like most about working at Amazon? He cited two things. \n\n“First, from day one, one no matter what your job is, you’re handed immense ownership immediately: you’ll be doing a lot of work that you normally you wouldn’t be doing on your own at another company.” \n\n“Second,’ he continued, “I can guarantee that you’ll work on something or be around something that didn’t exist at all when you started, that will be invented in the short time that you’re here. If you want to come invent and live in the future, you will do that at Amazon.”",

        "description": "On Monday, April 12th as nearly 1,000 participants started their fifth week of course instruction, we hosted our sixth Town Hall with guest speaker David Ortiz, CEO and Founder of SimWin Sports, which develops groundbreaking experiences at the intersection of fantasy sports, sports betting, and E-sports. \n\nDavid, also a Reskill Americans advisory board member, shared how he launched his career in software development with a testing internship at Atari while he was still in college, ultimately accepting his first salaried position with Atari at 19 years old. David joined Microsoft as the company was building Xbox in 2000, and he was the first person they hired with the tile game designer. He spoke about his long career in the video gaming and gaming industry, which includes jobs with EA Sports, Sony, Warner Brothers, and Abu Dhabi Media. \n\n“One of the things I like most about working in this industry,” said David, “Is that if you’ve done a good job building something (a game), people are going to bond over it, spend time on it, and use it as their social outlet.” \n\nDavid said that what’s exciting to him is that now, more than ever, there’s a need for a more diverse set of voices creating games. “This brings different experiences and perspectives, and that’s an amazing thing,” he said. \n\n“If you’re looking to come into the game space, now is the best time,” he said. Once you learn a few of the key skills (like Unreal or Unity), “then you can contribute to a team right away, and will have a skillset that is universally sought after.” When interviewing candidates, David often looks for people who have built something on their own, as a side passion project.",

        "description": "On Monday, April 19th as participants started their sixth week of course instruction, we hosted our seventh Town Hall with guest speaker Deborah Russell, from the Workforce Investment Council, a national governmental organization that provides people with job resources to help them enter the workforce.   \n\nDeborah is the Associate Director of Performance and Impact at the WIC in D.C. and has 20 years of experience helping Americans fulfill their employment and career goals. She said that American Job Centers (formerly known as unemployment offices) are available in every state, and sometimes in every borough. They offer everything from resume writing and interview skills to tips on how to dress for success. They also provide access to a workforce specialist that will focus on your career goals and will connect you to community resources should you need help with childcare, transportation, or clothing. She suggests that you call your local center and ask for affiliate centers, or Google American Job Centers and it will take you a website where you can type in your state and find the American Job Center in your area.  \n\n“I always tell people that we are the best kept secret, but that we shouldn’t be, because we provide a public opportunity and benefit for anybody who lives in the U.S.” \n\nWhen asked what advice to give people looking for a job, Deborah said: “The most important thing is stay up-to-date and informed. Knowing what’s available out there and being able to ask for it is what’s most important. Take advantage of those opportunities – we’re here to serve our customers who are looking for employment, so come see us.”",

        "description": "On Monday, April 26th, as participants started their seventh week of course instruction, we hosted our eighth Town Hall with two software engineers who work in technology groups at BlackRock, Inc., the world’s largest asset management company which has approximately 1,500 technologists.  \n\nOur guest speakers shared their backgrounds in software development, the tech skills required for their roles, typical projects that they work on at BlackRock, trends in the industry and much more. Ajax Green is Vice President and Senior Software Engineer in the Investment Systems group within the Aladdin Product Group, which manages technology used by researchers, portfolio managers, traders, risk managers and investment operations.  \n\n“Try to imagine anything you can think of that would be finance related, and we build software for it,” said Ajax. “From dividing up your portfolio into asset allocations to executing trades to coming up with new ideas.” \n\nAjax shared how when he was first hired as a developer in 2000, he was asked to write Java code on the job but didn’t know how to, so he read the O’Reilly book about it, twice. He said he still has to learn new things all of the time and at first, it always feels like you’re never going to figure it out.  \n\n“It always looks opaque at first, and you think, ‘there’s no way I’m going to figure it out,’” he said. “You have to work on it and work on it, and one day, the door opens and you figure it out. It’s about being persistent and not giving up, and knowing that if it can be built, it can be taken apart. It’s like a puzzle: you can’t see the solution for a long time but if you look at it long enough, the solution will present itself. \n\nMy Doan, Analyst, is an engineer in Alphagen Technology group, which helps BlackRock investment groups deliver strong alpha performance to clients by providing alpha-enabling technology and model engineering services. She started as an intern with BlackRock, and has been in a rotational analyst program for the past two years, rotating technology departments every six months.  \n\nWhen asked for advice about working computer programming, My said: “I found that you have to systematically break down the problem: what is the problem and how I’m trying to solve it. It’s a lot of problem-solving skills, because once you learn how to solve the problem, learning the language isn’t as complicated.”  \n\nAjax said one thing that people don’t seem to think about putting an investment in is the importance of interpersonal communications. “If you want to be successful in this role you have to be effective at communicating your ideas to other people: be able to talk in front of people, and describe your idea succinctly.”",

        "title": "Reskill Americans Hosts a Principal Software Engineer Manager at Microsoft for 9th Town Hall",
        "description": "On Monday, May 3rd, as participants started their eighth week of course instruction, we hosted our ninth Town Hall with Columbus Steward, a principal software engineer manager at Microsoft who was looking to hire a software developer to join his ten-person team.\n\nColumbus began his career at Microsoft 15 years ago, starting as a contractor in Redmond, WA. He was eventually hired full-time and moved through various businesses at Microsoft (including Windows, the App Store and Performance) to his current role in Azure. He currently manages an engineering team that builds software which manages demand for Azure offerings and services; he also oversees a data and analytics platform which provides data sets to the Azure Global organization to help them understand the business.\n\nAt the time, Columbus was hiring for a seasoned full stack developer with some front-end development, some familiarity with Single Page Applications framework, some services (API development experience), and some type of backend development (some variant of SQL). When hiring for these roles, he said that the soft skills he seeks include communications skills, problem solving skills, someone who is a team player, and someone who has a good sense of judgement. While the role on his team is no longer open, Columbus said that Microsoft is always hiring, and he encourages people to apply for open roles at the Microsoft career site here.\n\nWhen asked to share advice to people looking to break into their first internship or entry level position, Columbus had lot of helpful tips. “Stay curious, pop the hood,” he said. “When you encounter some piece of code, try to understand how things are working. Ask why this particular thing exists. And do: writers improve when they write, coders improve when they code. So, practice solving coding challenges and speaking the language. Create a GitHub portfolio and LinkedIn profile to create visibility and to stay aware of opportunities.”",

        "description": "On Monday, May 10th, as participants started their ninth week of course instruction, we hosted our 10th Town Hall with Eric Johnson, Director of Innovation at Bright Machines, which is an industrial automation start up that’s building the digital infrastructure for modern manufacturing. Eric showed footage of robots on the factory floors, and spoke about how technology is transforming the manufacturing industry and the growing demand for software development skills.\n\n“At Bright Machines, we’ve tried to bring together two worlds: the world of software and the world of process automation in the factory,” Eric said. He spoke about the range of career opportunities available in a factory setting, and said that the skills that Reskill Americans participants are learning are immediately applicable. “Even with basic python skills or front-end skills, you can contribute to any factory out there,” he said. (The challenge is that they just don’t know it yet; it takes pounding on the door to tell them they need help.)”\n\nBright Machines is hiring at all of its 12 locations, including in: Austin, TX., San Francisco, CA., Charlotte, N.C., Minneapolis, MN., Washington, D.C., Seattle, WA., Israel, China, Europe and two locations in Mexico. “And most importantly, we’re hiring at your kitchen table or garage,” Eric said, and showed a picture of a colleague’s garage, where Bright Machines will ship a robotic cell so that the employee can work remotely. To access the job board for Bright Machines, click here.\n\nEric spoke about the benefits of working in a team environment at a factory. “You get to work with a lot of different people and every single skill is required to keep the factory running,” he said. “Give factories a chance. They’re fun, they run on software, they need better software, and they need all kinds of different skills. At Bright Machines, we’re just doing our part to connect modern software with those places, and we need help!”\n\nTo learn more about Eric’s thoughts on the industry, you can read his article in The Robot Report or connect with Eric on LinkedIn:\n\nhttps://www.therobotreport.com/innovation-latency-in-industrial-automation/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjohnsonsf/",

        "title": "Reskill Americans Hosts Dev Nambi, Data Engineer at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center 11th Town Hall",
        "description": "On Monday, May 17th, as participants started their tenth week of course instruction, we hosted our 11th Town Hall with guest speaker Dev Nambi, Principal Data Engineer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (@fredhutch).   \n\nDev is currently working in Fred Hutch’s Data Core and Data Viz teams where he builds systems to empower scientists, enabling and accelerating the pace of research. Dev is a data scientist and data engineer and describes himself as a jack-of-all-trades developer and an aspiring polymath.  \n\nAt the Town Hall, Dev spoke about his job at Fred Hutch and gave lots of tips for people looking to launch a career in data science and software development.  He said that to be a good data scientist, you need to know software engineering, statistics, and the business domain you’re working in. “They say that data scientists know more about software engineering than any statistician and more about statistics than any software engineer.”   \n\nHe gave a typical problem that they would address at Fred Hutch. “Does smoking affect individual cellular DNA? If so, by how much, and can you actually test this? We are doing research so someday we could take a blood sample, sequence your DNA, and tell you.” Dev said the next step is obtaining the data and interpreting it. “Data-intensive visualization is available now; tools exist and the training is still in its infancy,” Dev said. “If you go to viz.fredhutch.org, you’ll see examples of cellular atlases: we sequence millions of cells and turn them into a visual atlas to see how different cell populations behave.”  \n\nIf you’re seeking a career in data science or software engineering, Dev suggests: “Do lots of side projects. Do projects that interest you and are personally compelling so that when you’re stuck and frustrated, you’ll keep going.” If you don’t have job experience in a particular field, such as in data science, Dev advises to do a side project that has broad relevance, addressing a challenge everyone faces. “Then write a blog series about it and post the data publicly,” he said.  (He once wrote a blog series about the data problem of buying a car, and looked at 500-600 different cars). “Have a blog and an online presence that showcases your work. If you’re going through a Bootcamp, academic course, or a program like Reskill Americans, write a blog about it.”  \n\nDev said that when interviewing, in some ways it’s an advantage if your background is in something totally different than a typical software engineer. Dev’s department had interviewed people who just came out of bootcamps and gave offers to those who had taken their Bootcamp very seriously.  “They had done more than just complete their courses and put it on their resumes,” he said. “They were able to talk about their projects and take it a step beyond. Curiosity, persistence, and communications skills are three big qualities that I look for in software engineers. That shows up in people when you interview them.”  \n\nWhile Fred Hutch isn’t hiring as many software engineers as it was before the pandemic, they are still hiring.

        "description": "On Monday, June 7th, as participants started the Project Phase (Phase II) of our program, we hosted our 13th Town Hall with SoftwareONE employees Nina Unger, Talent Acquisition Partner, and Bill Winans, Regional Director.    \n\nSoftwareONE is a global cloud software management and consulting company that created a 12-week training program, SoftwareONE Academy, to develop and recruit new talent into the firm. Nina and Bill shared details about the Academy, which is an apprenticeship program for entry-level technologists that seek additional training to launch their careers.   \n\nBill explained that because the software reseller is now pivoting into the professional services business, they’re seeing a “meteoric rise” in their technology service groups. “We want to find people  who can show base-level capabilities, and then we will upskill them ourselves.” The company is looking to recruit people that are eager to build their tech careers, starting in entry-level positions.   \n\nThe Academy has hired more than 20 people to date and aims to hire several thousand people across four different countries (including the U.S.). “We want to tap into nontraditional educational programs and leave no stone unturned in finding good talent and smart people,” Bill said. SoftwareONE will recruit people in different tracks and then pair them with a mentor in that area of specialization.  \n\nNina Unger, Talent Acquisition Partner said that the Academy is the bridge between someone’s existing training/education, and SoftwareONE’s on-the-job training.   \n\n  \n\nPeople who are recruited for the Academy will be paid an hourly wage for the first 6 weeks while completing the internship portion of the Academy.  In these first 6 weeks, there is hands-on training to upskill them to prepare for the full 12-week Academy program. Upon successful completion of the internship, they have the choice to continue into the 12- week intensive training program. Upon successful completion of the 12 weeks of training and certification, they have the opportunity to continue to work full-time as an associate and receive an annual salary (of $50,000) and full benefits.  After the first 12 months, they are eligible for a salary increase and to become bonus eligible. “We want you to find your home here, enjoy what you’re doing, and be here for a while,” said Nina.  \n\nThe next Academy programs being in November 2021 and January 2022.   \n\nSoftwareONE is headquartered in Switzerland and has a presence in over 90 countries, including five offices in the U.S. (and a U.S. headquarters in Wisconsin). The company has more than 7,700 employees and most of them work remotely. For more information, please visit the company’s YouTube (SoftwareONE careers YouTube) or social media (Instagram SoftwareONE Careers page).",

        "title": "Reskill Americans Hosts General Manager for Customer Experience at Microsoft Azure at 14th Town Hall",
        "description": "On Monday, June 14th, we hosted our 14th Town Hall with Laurent Pierre, General Manager of Customer Experience, Engineering Support (CXP) for Microsoft Azure. Laurent shared his background, the positions that his department is hiring for, the opportunities for candidates that have nontraditional (non-tech) backgrounds, and advice for how to grow your career in tech. \n\nAfter graduating from Howard University, Laurent worked on Capitol Hill and then the World Bank before taking a job in enterprise software management (such as ERP), where he spent 14 years at IBM.  In 2019, he was recruited to join Microsoft, where he now leads engineering support for Azure customers within the U.S. government, including for hospitals, first responders, and law enforcement agencies. \n\n“All throughout my career I have had to level up and skill up as each new job required me to learn a lot of new things,” he said and advised participants to try to become a subject matter expert in at least one tech area. “That will open doors for your future career.” \n\nLaurent’s team in the U.S. is about to double in size, and he described the open positions in his department, ranging from the entry-level (Azure Customer Engineer) to managerial (Lead to Principle). He also cited the skills required for each role and that candidates don’t necessarily need to have a bachelor’s or Computer Science degree.  \n\n“I met someone who used to be a bartender in Atlanta for over a decade who is now coding at Azure,” Laurent said, explaining that Microsoft hosts tech recruiting events across the country for people with experience in nontraditional backgrounds. “We have many stories like that. You just need experience and to have shown the ability to pick up technology and new skills.” \n\n He also suggested checking out Microsoft’s career page at  https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en and search for internships and apprenticeship programs. (But apply early and understand when internships start and end as it varies depending on needs.) Microsoft has been deliberate about increasing its diverse workforce. “We have to represent the people that we serve,” Laurent said. \n\nWhen asked for additional advice about building a career in technology, Laurent said that non-technical skills are also essential. “Know how to interact with different personalities and have a set of core values you bring with you. Know what you bring to the table, but also leave room to hear other perspectives as well.” \n\nMicrosoft is the fifth technology company where Laurent has worked and he said he’s never seen a company that is as engaged with its diverse employee groups and as committed to diversity. “The fact that we’re given the opportunity to drive diversity across everything that we do is a huge opportunity. “",

David started his career at Microsoft as an intern, and has over 13 years of experience working on developer frameworks and tools. He is also on the advisory board for Reskill Americans.  In his current role, David’s responsibilities include working on .NET and the Azure SignalR service, a scalable service for running web, mobile and IoT applications in the cloud.  \n\nIn our Town Hall, David shared details about what happens in a technical Interview (both phone screen and full Interview), what he looks for in a good technical candidate, what kind of technical questions to expect, and a sample (no- technical) interview question.  \n\n“I personally look to see if the person has done anything that they’re passionate about: have you done anything on the side that has taught you some skill that you wouldn't have otherwise learned if you hadn’t done the project?” David said. “I like when people explain their projects with passion because it helps me understand that they care about it in the first place.”  \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfowl/",

        "description": "We sat down with Marina Nitze, a former CTO and entrepreneur, to address questions from our participants that are considering freelancing or starting their own businesses. Marina started her career in 2000 with a business as a web developer for celebrity websites, and 13 years later, she was serving as CTO of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (2013-2017). During her career in government, Marina helped found the United States Digital Service and served as a Senior Advisor on technology in the White House under the Obama Administration. Marina’s portfolio included vets.gov, a single digital destination for Veterans to manage, apply for and track the benefits they earned. Her team was also the first to bring commercial cloud computing and modern development practices, including continuous integration and deployment, to the VA. \n\nMarina shared insights about how to launch your own business, how to find freelance work, and the power of being curious and solving problems. \n\n “Once a customer gets to know you and sees that you’re good at ‘X’ – whatever ‘X’ is – they are probably a lot more inclined to let you do ‘Y’ even if you maybe aren’t as good at ‘Y’, so looking for those growth opportunities can be pretty cool.” \n\nMarina is currently a Public Interest Tech Fellow for the think tank New America, where she focuses on best practices in child welfare. \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/marinanitze/",

        "description": "On October 21st, HBO Max, a WarnerMedia company, hosted a Job Fair with Reskill Americans to share details about more than 100 of its open roles ranging from software developers and UX roles to product designers and program managers. \n\nNoreli Garcia Valentin, Director of Strategic Initiatives & Chair of Equity and Inclusion at WM’s Direct to Consumer organization spoke about current and future opportunities with HBO Max, the interview process, and how to apply. HBO Max, a standalone streaming platform that launched in 2020, expanded to 40 markets with the addition of Latin America in July 2021 and is scaling to 190 countries over the next year. \n\n“I know there’s a lot of competition out there for your amazing talent and skills, and we are aware of that,” Noreli said. “So, for us, bringing a culture of innovation that is supportive of diversifying and getting more underrepresented communities into our pipeline is critical because that’s what our customer base is, that’s what the majority demands, and it’s really our values. We are a media company that is powered by tech and that moves culture through stories.”",
